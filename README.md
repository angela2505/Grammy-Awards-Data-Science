## Project Overview

The **Grammy Awards Data Science** project aims to analyze and visualize data related to the Grammy Awards. We focus on various aspects, including nominations, winners, and public sentiment. Our goal is to derive insights and present them in a clear, engaging manner.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NLTK** and **spaCy**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Beautiful Soup** and **Scrapy**: For web scraping.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and presentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angela2505/Grammy-Awards-Data-Science.git
   cd Grammy-Awards-Data-Science
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Access the Releases**:

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is crucial for understanding trends and patterns. We use various charts and graphs to present our findings clearly. Some visualizations include:

- **Bar Charts**: To show the number of nominations and wins per artist.
- **Pie Charts**: To illustrate the distribution of genres among winners.
- **Line Graphs**: To track changes in public sentiment over time.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps us understand the dataset's structure and relationships. We perform:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: To summarize the main characteristics of the data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: To find relationships between different variables.
- **Missing Value Analysis**: To identify and handle missing data points.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a significant role in analyzing text data. We focus on:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or phrases.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like artists and songs.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

We analyze public sentiment regarding the Grammy Awards using sentiment analysis techniques. This involves:

- **Text Classification**: Classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Word Clouds**: Visualizing the most common words in positive and negative reviews.

## Profanity Detection

In our analysis, we also check for profanity in user-generated content. This helps maintain a respectful discourse around the awards. We use a predefined list of profane words and apply NLP techniques to identify them.

## LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

LDA is a topic modeling technique that helps us discover hidden topics in a collection of documents. We apply LDA to:

- Identify common themes in Grammy-related articles.
- Group similar documents based on topic similarity.

## Web Scraping

We gather data from various online sources using web scraping techniques. This allows us to:

- Collect historical Grammy Awards data.
- Monitor real-time sentiment from social media platforms.
